Option 2- Time Management:
“Can you help me work through something that’s been bothering me related to time management by using cognitive restructuring? I’d like to talk about what’s been happening, how it makes me feel, and explore whether there’s another way I could look at it. I want this to be a caring, attentive conversation, with a high degree of interaction between us. I’d like you to help me explore my thoughts, emotions, and behaviors around time, and help guide me through the process of cognitive restructuring.”
