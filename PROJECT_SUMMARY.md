- **College Student Mental Health**: Addressing the unique mental health challenges of student populations
- **Technology-Mediated Therapy**: Investigating AI as a therapeutic support tool
- **Preventive Mental Health**: Early intervention strategies for emotional regulation

## üìä Research Design & Methodology

### Study Framework
- **Design**: Longitudinal intervention study with repeated measures
- **Duration**: 2-3 weeks per participant
- **Sessions**: 6 structured AI conversation sessions
- **Population**: College students aged 18-25
- **Sample Size**: [To be determined based on power analysis]

### Assessment Framework
**Primary Measures**:
- **ATQ (Automatic Thoughts Questionnaire)**: Measures negative automatic thoughts
- **CERQ (Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire)**: Assesses cognitive coping strategies  
- **PSS (Perceived Stress Scale)**: Evaluates stress perception
- **AJ SRS (Student Reflection Scale)**: Measures reflective thinking capacity

**Secondary Measures**:
- Session feedback and satisfaction ratings
- Qualitative session transcripts
- Engagement and participation metrics

### Intervention Protocol
Each session follows a structured three-phase approach:
1. **Pre-Session Assessment** (15 min): Standardized psychological measures
2. **AI Conversation Session** (20-30 min): Guided reflective dialogue
3. **Post-Session Assessment** (15 min): Reflection and feedback collection

## üéØ Research Objectives

### Primary Research Questions
1. How do AI-assisted conversations affect participants' emotional well-being over time?
2. What changes occur in automatic thought patterns following AI intervention?
3. How do participants' stress levels and coping strategies evolve during the study?
4. What is the relationship between AI interaction frequency and reflective thinking capacity?
