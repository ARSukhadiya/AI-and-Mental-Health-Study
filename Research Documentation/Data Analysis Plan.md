# Data Analysis Plan: AI and Mental Health Study

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive data analysis strategy for the AI and Mental Health Study, including statistical approaches, data management procedures, and analytical frameworks for evaluating the impact of AI-assisted conversations on college students' emotional well-being.

## Research Hypotheses

### Primary Hypotheses
1. **H1**: Participants will show significant improvements in emotional well-being scores across the 6-session intervention period
2. **H2**: Negative automatic thoughts (ATQ scores) will decrease significantly from baseline to post-intervention
3. **H3**: Cognitive emotion regulation strategies (CERQ scores) will show positive changes in adaptive coping mechanisms
4. **H4**: Perceived stress levels (PSS scores) will decrease significantly over the intervention period

### Secondary Hypotheses
1. **H5**: Reflective thinking capacity (AJ SRS scores) will increase with session progression
2. **H6**: Session engagement and satisfaction will correlate positively with outcome improvements
3. **H7**: Individual differences in baseline characteristics will moderate intervention effects

## Data Management

### Data Collection Framework
- **Primary Data**: Quantitative assessment scores from standardized measures
- **Secondary Data**: Qualitative session transcripts and feedback responses
- **Demographic Data**: Age, gender, academic year, prior mental health history
- **Engagement Data**: Session completion rates, response times, interaction patterns

### Data Quality Assurance
- **Completeness Checks**: Missing data identification and management
- **Consistency Validation**: Cross-session score reliability assessment
- **Outlier Detection**: Statistical identification of extreme values
- **Protocol Adherence**: Verification of standardized administration procedures

### Data Storage and Security
- **De-identification**: Removal of personal identifiers from analysis datasets
- **Encryption**: Secure storage of sensitive participant information
- **Access Control**: Limited access to raw data files
- **Backup Procedures**: Regular data backup and recovery protocols

## Statistical Analysis Strategy

### Descriptive Statistics
- **Demographic Summary**: Participant characteristics and baseline profiles
- **Score Distributions**: Normality assessment and descriptive statistics
- **Missing Data Patterns**: Analysis of data completeness across sessions
- **Engagement Metrics**: Session participation and completion rates

### Primary Analyses

#### 1. Longitudinal Change Analysis
**Method**: Mixed-effects models with repeated measures
- **Dependent Variables**: ATQ, CERQ, PSS, AJ SRS scores
- **Independent Variables**: Session number, time point
- **Random Effects**: Participant ID
- **Fixed Effects**: Session, baseline characteristics, demographic factors

**Statistical Software**: R (lme4 package) or SPSS (MIXED procedure)

#### 2. Pre-Post Session Comparisons
**Method**: Paired t-tests or Wilcoxon signed-rank tests
- **Comparisons**: Pre vs. post each session
- **Effect Sizes**: Cohen's d for standardized mean differences
- **Significance Level**: α = 0.05 with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons

#### 3. Overall Intervention Effects
**Method**: Repeated measures ANOVA or MANOVA
- **Time Points**: Baseline, mid-intervention (Session 3), post-intervention
- **Effect Sizes**: Partial eta-squared for effect magnitude
- **Post-hoc Tests**: Tukey HSD for significant main effects

### Secondary Analyses

#### 1. Individual Differences Analysis
**Method**: Moderation analysis using hierarchical linear modeling
- **Moderators**: Age, gender, academic year, baseline scores
- **Outcomes**: Rate of change in primary measures
- **Interaction Terms**: Moderator × Time interactions

#### 2. Dose-Response Analysis
**Method**: Linear and curvilinear regression models
- **Predictors**: Number of sessions completed, engagement metrics
- **Outcomes**: Final scores on primary measures
- **Model Selection**: AIC/BIC criteria for best fit

#### 3. Mediation Analysis
**Method**: Structural equation modeling or PROCESS macro
- **Mediators**: Reflective thinking capacity, session satisfaction
- **Outcomes**: Emotional well-being improvements
- **Bootstrap Confidence Intervals**: 95% CI with 5000 resamples

### Qualitative Data Analysis

#### 1. Session Transcript Analysis
**Method**: Thematic analysis using NVivo or similar software
- **Coding Framework**: Deductive and inductive coding approaches
- **Themes**: Emotional expression, cognitive patterns, AI interaction experiences
- **Inter-rater Reliability**: Cohen's kappa for coding consistency

#### 2. Feedback Response Analysis
**Method**: Content analysis and sentiment analysis
- **Categories**: Positive experiences, challenges, suggestions for improvement
- **Sentiment Scoring**: Automated and manual coding approaches
- **Integration**: Triangulation with quantitative findings

## Power Analysis and Sample Size

### Power Calculations
- **Primary Outcome**: ATQ score changes
- **Effect Size**: Medium effect (d = 0.5) based on similar interventions
- **Power**: 0.80 (80% power to detect significant effects)
- **Alpha**: 0.05 (5% significance level)
- **Required Sample Size**: [To be calculated based on effect size estimates]

### Sample Size Considerations
- **Attrition Rate**: 15% expected dropout rate
- **Missing Data**: 10% expected missing data rate
- **Final Sample**: Adjusted for anticipated data loss

## Effect Size Interpretation

### Cohen's Guidelines
- **Small Effect**: d = 0.2 (minimal practical significance)
- **Medium Effect**: d = 0.5 (moderate practical significance)
- **Large Effect**: d = 0.8 (substantial practical significance)

### Clinical Significance
- **Minimal Clinically Important Difference**: Based on normative data
- **Reliable Change Index**: Individual-level significance testing
- **Clinical Cutoffs**: Established thresholds for clinical populations

## Assumptions and Limitations

### Statistical Assumptions
- **Normality**: Distribution of residuals in linear models
- **Independence**: Observations within and between participants
- **Homoscedasticity**: Equal variance across groups and time points
- **Linearity**: Linear relationships between variables

### Limitations
- **Self-report Bias**: Reliance on participant self-assessment
- **Hawthorne Effect**: Awareness of participation in research
- **Generalizability**: College student population limitations
- **Technology Dependence**: AI system reliability and consistency

## Reporting Standards
