Hello,

Are you interested in psychology, mental health, or emerging technologies? We are conducting a research study at San Francisco Bay University exploring how prompted conversation with AI may influence emotional well-being in college students.

The study involves:

6 short sessions of prompted conversation with AI over 2–3 weeks
Brief surveys on mood and thought patterns
You may be eligible if you are:

A college student aged 18–25
Fluent in English
Not currently diagnosed with a neurological condition
You’ll receive course credit or a gift card as a thank-you.

If you’re interested or have questions, please contact:
