## Study Overview

### Purpose
This study investigates how structured conversations with AI may influence emotional well-being, mood patterns, and cognitive processes in college students. The research explores the potential of AI as a mental health support tool and its effectiveness in promoting emotional regulation.

### Research Questions
1. How do AI-assisted conversations affect participants' emotional well-being over time?
2. What changes occur in automatic thought patterns following AI intervention?
3. How do participants' stress levels and coping strategies evolve during the study?
4. What is the relationship between AI interaction frequency and reflective thinking capacity?

## Methodology

### Study Design
- **Type**: Longitudinal intervention study
- **Duration**: 2-3 weeks per participant
- **Sessions**: 6 structured AI conversation sessions
- **Assessment Points**: Pre-intervention, post-session, and follow-up

### Participant Population
- **Target**: College students aged 18-25
- **Sample Size**: [To be determined based on power analysis]
- **Inclusion Criteria**:
  - Currently enrolled college student
  - Age 18-25
  - Fluent in English
  - Willing to participate in 6 sessions
- **Exclusion Criteria**:
  - Current neurological condition diagnosis
  - Severe mental health conditions requiring immediate intervention
  - Inability to provide informed consent

### Intervention Protocol

#### Session Structure
Each session consists of three phases:

1. **Pre-Session Assessment** (15 minutes)
   - ATQ (Automatic Thoughts Questionnaire)
   - CERQ (Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire)
   - PSS (Perceived Stress Scale)

2. **AI Conversation Session** (20-30 minutes)
   - Guided prompts from standardized protocol
   - AI-assisted reflective conversation
   - Real-time mood tracking

3. **Post-Session Assessment** (15 minutes)
   - AJ SRS (Student Reflection Scale)
   - Session feedback questionnaire
   - Mood state assessment

#### AI Conversation Guidelines
- Structured prompts designed to promote self-reflection
- Non-directive, supportive AI responses
- Focus on emotional awareness and cognitive restructuring
- Consistent session length and format

### Assessment Tools

#### Primary Measures
1. **ATQ (Automatic Thoughts Questionnaire)**
   - Purpose: Measure negative automatic thoughts
   - Frequency: Pre and post each session
   - Scoring: 30-item scale

2. **CERQ (Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire)**
   - Purpose: Assess cognitive coping strategies
   - Frequency: Pre and post each session
   - Scoring: 36-item scale

3. **PSS (Perceived Stress Scale)**
   - Purpose: Evaluate stress perception
   - Frequency: Pre and post each session
   - Scoring: 10-item scale

#### Secondary Measures
1. **AJ SRS (Student Reflection Scale)**
   - Purpose: Measure reflective thinking capacity
   - Frequency: Post each session
   - Scoring: Custom scale

2. **Session Feedback Questionnaire**
   - Purpose: Assess participant experience
   - Frequency: Post each session
   - Scoring: Qualitative and quantitative items
